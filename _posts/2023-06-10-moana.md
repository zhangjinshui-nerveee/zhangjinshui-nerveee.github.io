This project, similar to the <a href="/2024-01-01-mpstms.md">mps-tms project</a> as well as other multilevel / modular pulse synthesizer you may see now or in the future, have a similar outlook. However, their main difference is the implementation of transistors, consequently the switching rates and power level. Compared with SiC FETs, the gallium nitride (GaN) transistors used here can provide a much faster switching rate, i.e. 5 MHz hard switching, with a fairly smaller current capability.

*Ultimate goal of this project: multichannel stimulator.*

This project aims to stimulate different frequency channels simutaneously with a lower intensity compared with TMS -- the mechanism is magnetogenetics. The channels may vary from 5 kHz to 5 MHz, thus requiring a ultra wide output bandwidth at kW power level.
