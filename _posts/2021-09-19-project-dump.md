Before my phd, I have worked hard through my way in both industry and academia. I have enjoyed some of them, but not passionate enough to write separate blogs for them. So here in this article, I will just dump every major prototype I have developed or led with a brief introduction. I doubt that anyone now would be interested in them anymore -- power electronics is moving really fast nowadays. But in case you are indeed interested, I still have their design documents, and am ready to give them away for free -- just shoot me an email.

## Totem-Pole Power Factor Correction Rectifier

This is a work of my one-year part-time internship with a local company in Xi'an. Not only just one prototype, I was also hired to give lectures of power electronics to their technicians -- I would have felt used, but luckily I actually liked teaching.

## Compact GaN Rectifier

*A 150 W full-GaN rectifier.*

This is the work for a competition funded by GaN Systems (now a part of Infineon) in China. We worked really hard but wasn't eventually strong enough to compete with other stong teams. It was a great experience -- I still remember how it smells when a GaN transistor burns. 

## Stackable LLC DC-DC Converter

I was so bored when I already submitted my thesis and waiting for my visa to fly to USA. And I suddely decided to do something different about LLC, a topic which I don't actually know much about. And LLC was everywhere. Eventually I figured out a way to connect different boards with one connector while parallel their output (thanks to gorgeous Taobao, that might be the only thing I miss here in America). There isn't actually any outcome from this prototype, except some fun for myself.
