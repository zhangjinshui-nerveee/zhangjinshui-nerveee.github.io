## Background
Trancranial magnetic stimulation, abbreviated as TMS, works by firing a magnetic pulse over your head to excite activities of the neurons in your brain and optionally your peripheral neural system, so to modulate our neurons and body functionalities.

The discovery of interaction between electric stimulation and neurons can be traced back to a long time ago (when, where, who and what?). The amazing Faraday also found that the magnetic field is actually associated with electric potential. The most familiar decription to us might be the Maxwell equations. 
Anyways, ground facts: electric potentials can stimulate neurons, and alternating magnetic fields can generate electric potentials, alternating or constant. Naturally we can ask a question: what would happen if we use magnetic field on neurons? That's the origin of TMS. But certainly, that's not the whole story of TMS -- things got even more strange, and exciting. 

People realized that TMS can be used as both as a trigger to study our brains, and as a therapeutic treatment, which is a real game changer. People now use TMS to treat drug-resistant major depression disorder.

My interpretation is that, when a car has a low battery, it can start its engine and run on the highway to recharge its battery. That the secret why we never need to take off our car battery and carry them home for charging. But when a car has a dead battery, there is no way to start the engine by itself, thus no way to charge its battery -- and no way to start the engine. That's an analog to us having depression. It by no means is accurate, but I have to confess that I don't know how exactly TMS treats depression, probably no one does -- there is no mathematic model to describe this process, therefore, to me as an engineer, I can't claim that I know how it works. 

But how do we know TMS works to treat depression? Because it works. 

Back in dark days before Newton, we know that gravity works, but we don't know how gravity works. We know that the apple has to drop to the ground instead of flying up to the sky, but there isn't an explanation for why it happened. 

I really wish I am smart enough to work on the mathmetic modeling of TMS influencing mental disorders or the whole brain. Unfortunately I am not on that track, but fortunately there are more intelligent people working on that. 

I am an engineer -- I don't explain how gravity works, but I work on how to use the gravity more efficiently, like how to accurately throw a ball into a bucket. To effectively and accurately throw a ball into a bucket, we need to know how to use the fact of gravity. We can change the angle of tossing the ball, or the force of it, or the correct magic words to speak to the ball before throwing it out. Some of the measures would work, some wouldn't. The example here might be obvious that which ones work and which ones do not, but trust me, when you don't have a ground understanding of something, it's tricky. 
Let's go back to TMS, so how do we use TMS more efficiently? Try different approaches! So what kinds of setups can we try on TMS sessions? Intensity, of course. Pulse shape? Definitely! Timing? Yes. Position? Too obvious. TV shows you watch the day before you get the TMS session? Let's not go too far from there. 

## Implementation 
Unfortunately, the machine that is used to generate TMS pulses, called TMS stimulator, used to be have very limited functionalities, until now. Thanks to modular power electronics, we built a 2.8 kV / 6 kA stimulator, which can be used to synthesize TMS pulses of flexible shape. 
- If you are an electric engineer, the best explanation of it is a mega volt-ampere DAC converter.
- If you are a neuro-scientist, it is a god-like stimulator: capable of any pulse shape (mono-/bi-phasic, half-sine) of any prototype (single / paired pulse, theta-delta, burst) at any repetitive rate you may want.
