"We should not fight our computers." -- <em>How Linux Works.</em>

As a power electronics engineer, I deal with circuit boards all the time. When I test their functionality, the most scary thing is not that they always fail, like ten failures or explosions out of ten trials. The most terrible thing is that they only fail once out of ten or a hundred trials. Predictable failure is much better than unpredictable success. You can always fix a problem, but not always feasible to fix a "mystery".

Due to my work needs, I still have to do most of my work on Windows -- that might be one of the leading frustrations throughout my PhD. Windows is easy to start with -- everyone knows how to use it. But it's always not perfect:
- the start menu search sometimes won't take my keyboard input
- it may or may not recognize the only one external monitor that I have used with it
- you never know when it's gonna start upgrading itself (actually most people complain about it, but I feel that the pause updates function is working well with me)

I can list so many things that Windows has surprised me with. Hopefully someday I can get rid of it, but now I am stuck due to the necessary use of LabVIEW FPGA development, Altium Designer. I believe there are lots of people like me, we really don't have a choice on which os to use. 

However, we do indeed have a choice on other softwares, softwares that are easier to understand and customize. After all, the softwares serve us instead of the opposite way. I don't think we should be trained by the softwares. It just does not make sense to me that we have to learn or even guess what results our software might give us. 

We may never be able to understand all the little details or behaviors of the software we are using. However, we should reserve the right to be able to do so. Open-source is crucial for this philosophy. Here I share some tools that I believe fit this principle.
- vim
- embedded development (if allowed a choice): anything but labview
- cad: kicad, tinkercad
- terminal. Microsoft is a notorious company, however, their powershell is decent to use. (Of course, it might not be on the same level of bash or zsh, but it's much better than windows explorer.)
- minimized use of ai. Use ai purposefully and cautiously.
