Have you ever struggled to settle down on the style of your personal website? Well, I have, a lot. There are just so many options on the internet, beautiful and free. I used to switch my website from one template to another all the time. I didn't do this for fun, every time I switch, I was literally urged to do so because I felt my previous one was so ugly and it disgusted me too much. If you felt the same way, shake hands. 

I took my time on bus home to think about this problem -- yes, one thing I really love about taking a bus over driving is that you can really use your time to think about all kind of strange or nonsense questions without worrying that your distraction might kill someone or yourself. I realized that the root cause for me obsessively frequently changing my e-portfolio is my ambiguous interpretation of its function. Yes, it could be your cv, it could be your blog, it could be your gallery, it could be anything, but it can not be just anything. It has to serve ONE purpose for you, just you, and not the ones who developed those fancy templates. That's why the website repositories I picked from tons of others all end up looking disgusting to me. Once the first impression or the freshness phased out, the conflict between the tastes of the original designer and your actual needs makes you feel uncomfortable everytime you visit your website. And this unease eventually accumulates into panic and disgust, especially when everyone else is also using the same template and trying to fill out all the categories that the original design has provided (hey, maybe because, just like me, they simply don't know how to delete the entries but don't want to leave them empty). 

We do not necessarily have to suffer. Figure out our needs is the first step, and this is mine -- my personal website should be a supplement to my cv. As I have only very limited space in my cv for my research and projects, some of them may lose the technical or interesting part. I decided to complete these materials on this website, include demonstrations as well as stories (comedy or tragedy) behind all these "achievements" on my cv. Meanwhile, I can't be a real person on cv, I doubt that any one could. Therefore, I will also share some of my thoughts on work and real life, like this one. 

A text-based website will serve all of my needs. That's it.
