## Prerequisite Knowledge
1. Quantizer is a process where modular multilevel converter digitizes continuous input to discrete output level commands.
2. Nearest level modulation has low switching rate but low quantizing quality.
3. Carrier based PWM has high switching rate but high quantizing quality.

## Essence of This Paper
A quantizing method combining Nearest level modulation and an one-bit PWM approach. Instead a simple combination, we realized that one-bit PWM only works if the input signal has a constrained bandwidth, otherwise this quantizer method is equivalent to level-shifted-carrier PWM. Therefore, we added a low-pass filter before feeding the residue of NLM to PWM.
