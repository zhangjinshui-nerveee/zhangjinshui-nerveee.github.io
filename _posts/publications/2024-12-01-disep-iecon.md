## Prerequisite Knowledge
1. Working principle of cascaded double H bridge circuit

## Essence of This Paper
As it can enable parallel connection between modules, the cascaded double H bridge (CH2B) circuit can achieve sensorless module balancing. However, it needs eight transistors while the original H bridge needs only four -- which scares people away from using it. Here we invented a new module strucutre, four transistor -- not eight, not seven, not six, not five, just four -- to achieve the same functionality of sensorless module balancing.
