## AI for power electronics
In this section, I will list Ai tools that can be used (not explicitly) for power electronics. 

### Chat Bots
I use both chatgpt and google gemini in a similar amount. In this section, I will list the moments when they surprise me (with brilliant or stupid responses).

#### Positive

#### Negative

###  PCB design

#### AI assisted
- DeepPCB: [DeepPCB](https://deeppcb.ai/) is the AI-powered, fully autonomous printed circuit board tool that accelerates the design process and ups industrial-grade PCB performance. Create and scale your product without compromise, and only pay for what you use.

### AI dominated


### Coding Assistant
- Gemini-Cli: it's huge. It has lots power, but it also needs lots of power, and it seems to acquire so from you, secretly. I would be very cautious of using this tool -- it can do so many things without you knowing about it.
- Circuit Mind. [Their claim of speeding up by 75%](https://www.circuitmind.io/) seems to be more conservative than Deep PCB, thus more trustworthy (to me)?


## Power Electronics for AI: Power Consumption
Here I will update news / opinions on the power consumption of AI computing.

### Why are our brains so power efficient but current neural networks are not? 

### Neuromorphic computing: can it be our Savior?
