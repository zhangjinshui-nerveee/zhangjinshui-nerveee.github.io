Protein is surely essential for us, especially for body builders and older people. Here is a great article about it.

This blog is to relate protein consumption to carbon emissions.

| Food          | CO2 (kg) per 100 g protein | Calories per g protein |
| --            | --                         | --                     |
| beef          | 49.89                      | 8.30                   |
| lamb          | 19.85                      | 10.1                   |
| cheese        | 10.82                      | 15.8                   |
| milk          | 9.5                        | 18.6                   |

| eggs          | 4.21                       | 11.8                   |
| tofu          | 1.98                       | 8.75                   |
| grains        | 2.7                        | ??                     |                  
| oatmeal       | 1.91                       | 24.1                   |
| nuts          | 0.26                       | ??                     |                  
| wheat & Rye   | 1.29                       | ??                     |                  
| edamame       | ??                         | 12.4                   |
| hemp seeds    | ??                         | 20                     |                  
| peanuts       | 1.23                       | 21.4                   |

Here are my takes on low-carbon-emission protein consumption.
0. A firm **NO** to anything related to **COWS**
1. **REDUCE RED** meat consumption
2. All **VEG**etables are better than any kind of meat
