This blog lists Ai tools that are designed for power electronics. 

<p style="color: gray; font-size: smaller;">I am not convinced yet that we really need AI to control our power systems; this collection will mostly about for off-line designs.</p>


- DeepPCB: [Website link](https://deeppcb.ai/) is the AI-powered, fully autonomous printed circuit board tool that accelerates the design process and ups industrial-grade PCB performance. Create and scale your product without compromise, and only pay for what you use.
- CircuitSynth. [Paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10977). Circuit topology synthesis using LLM.
- frenetic.ai: [Website link](https://www.frenetic.ai/) Design power supply in minutes - with AI.
- AI-Mag. ETH work. [Link](https://ai-mag.github.io/). Inductor Modeling and Design with FEM/ANN.
- PE-GPT. [Repo here](https://github.com/XinzeLee/PE-GPT). I am still questioning the significance of such GPT-like models over general-purpose models such as chatgpt / gemini. 
- Circuit Mind. [Their claim of speeding up by 75%](https://www.circuitmind.io/) seems to be more conservative than Deep PCB, thus more trustworthy (to me)?

## My Curiosities
<p style="color: gray; font-size: smaller;">I have a question.</p>

- What energy source do we need to train AI? Is it true the nuclear plants will be our only solution?
- Is power electronics a science, or a craft? 
- Why are people so passionate about developing ai to eliminate their work needs, knowing that eventually it benefits nobody but these capitalist?
- What can we learn from brain structure to benefit power electronics?
  - embedded / distributed liquid-cooling.
  - communication mechanism?
