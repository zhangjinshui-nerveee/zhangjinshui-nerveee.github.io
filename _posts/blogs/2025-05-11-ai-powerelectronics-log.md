## AI for power electronics
In this section, I will list Ai tools designed for power electronics. 

<p style="color: red; font-size: smaller;">I am not convinced yet that we really need AI based control algorithms for our power systems; this collection will mostly be for off-line designs.</p>


- DeepPCB: [Website link](https://deeppcb.ai/) is the AI-powered, fully autonomous printed circuit board tool that accelerates the design process and ups industrial-grade PCB performance. Create and scale your product without compromise, and only pay for what you use.
- CircuitSynth. [Paper link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10977). Circuit topology synthesis using LLM.
- frenetic.ai: [Website link](https://www.frenetic.ai/) Design power supply in minutes - with AI.
- AI-Mag. ETH work. [Link](https://ai-mag.github.io/). Inductor Modeling and Design with FEM/ANN.
- PE-GPT. [Repo here](https://github.com/XinzeLee/PE-GPT). I am still questioning the significance of such GPT-like models over general-purpose models such as chatgpt / gemini. 
- Circuit Mind. [Their claim of speeding up by 75%](https://www.circuitmind.io/) seems to be more conservative than Deep PCB, thus more trustworthy (to me)?

## My Curiosities
- What energy source do we need for training AI? Is it true the nuclear plants will be our only solution?
- Is power electronics still a subject of science? 
- Why is everyone trying to eliminate their work needs by AI? This is a terrifying game, indeed. The first one gets the most by killing all the rest. Not just in power electronics -- biology, mechanical eng, etc., even machine learning itself.
