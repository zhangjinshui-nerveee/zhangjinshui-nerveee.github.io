"Green" refers to activities that generate little or limited amount of carbon emission and pollutions. Green transportation, as a result, covers public transportation (buses, trains, subways), electric vehicles with green energy source, and non-vehicle involved commuting such as walking, biking, scooting. 

Every summer, almost all people who do not live in cold places, would ask the same question: why is it so hot? We ask this question because it is hot, and hotter. It refreshes our impression of summer hotness and that's why we question the temperature. And it is true -- our global temperature has been rising steadily faster. In 2024, the average global temperature has risen a whole celsius degree -- a new record. 

When people choose their commuting approach, particularly under such a context, naturally we may think: we should drive since it's so hot. I don't want to wait under the sun for dozens of minutes for a bus, and then have a walk over to my office. That's fair. But as human beings, we shall be able to think about this situation with a little bit more sophistication.

We drive because it is so hot, or it is so hot because we drive? 

It's not a philosophic question like chickens and eggs. It's a simple truth -- the global temperature has been synchronizing with our carbon emission since ever. These data are public and anyone can get access to it.

Some people do act on it, particularly Europeans and Chinese -- two pioneers on public transportation. The difference between these two is that Europeans act more actively while we Chinese may have taken the buses and subways because we have to (cars weren't very affordable 10 years ago). 
But the greatest carbon emitter, USA, is not doing its job; it doesn't even care to pretend. 

Having lived in USA for four years, here is my impression about everything I see here: they are hard to change, but easy, super easy, to understand -- anything that can make profit is possible, and very likely, to happen in USA. 
Profitable is never one of the properties of public transportation -- actually nonprofitable is. In China, having been built and put into use for several decades, most railways are still in deficit if we try to calculate their profits. I believe the same thing happens to Europe too. 

America is just so car-centered. When I watch a basketball game, half of the ads in time outs are about cars, while the other half is about fast foods. Yep. 

But why is it so hard to have a greener transportation system here? 

The public transportation is doomed. We want three to four things from public transportation: on time, clean, safe, and maybe not too pricy (it should be at least cheaper than driving). Buses almost failed all these requirements. Train is good, but it's so slow and expensive -- it's even more expensive than taking a plane sometimes. 
Here, taking the public transportation is a great way to show your toughness. Yes, I have waited for a bus for forty minutes, which according to Google map it should have arrived half hour ago, and now the temperature is 38 celsius degree. But I care about the environment! 
I appaud for people who are doing this; and I am usually one of them. But buses just should not be this way -- it should be a way to be lazy and cozy instead of to suffer.

The electric vehicles are interesting here. 
Tesla used to be a symbol of personalities: smart, wealthy, responsible people drive Tesla, period. Now we can agree that Mr. Musk ruined that for every Tesla car and every Tesla driver. But the poor EV market here, I think we can still blame part of it on Mr. Musk's arogance, eventually unveils people's poor consciousness about climate problems. 

Talking about how. 

We need the buses to be more attractive -- I really just mean getting to the bus stop within 10 min to when it's supposed to, and not smell too bad -- to people. 

We also need to make taking buses better than driving. Cars are already pretty expensive -- gas, insurance, property taxes -- but people seems to be okay to be paying for their cars even when they have no savings in the bank. I can understand that people see cars as a symbol of freedom -- you can go anywhere you want when you are behind the wheel. However, when you don't have to drive a car, like going to work, driving is actually killing your free mind. When you are driving, your mind has to be tied to the wheel. You lost so many hours that you could have used your brain for something better instead of carrying you and your car from places to places. Reading is a big reason why I like taking a bus.

So we have a cure? Yes and no. As an electrical engineer student, the more I think about using technology to make transportation cleaner, the more helpless I feel because eventually it's not a technical issue -- it's a political issue. 

People in the suits like cars -- they bring money, and buses / bike lanes don't.
