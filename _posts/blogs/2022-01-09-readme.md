This website is a personal portfolio, and provides the following information.
- Selected projects. I introduce my projects with as little jargon as possible for a general audience.
- Selected publications. Different from academic writing (and packaging?), here I try to analyze every paper straight to their point. 
- Open source project that I led or participated in.
- Blogs. 

Here are the rules I follow when creating on this website.
- I don't dare to waste your time. I will try to be as straightforward and simple as possible. 
- I respect your attention. Anything you read here can only be found here; if they are borrowed from somewhere else (even my own material), I will make sure to provide the sources. 
- You are interacting with a real person here. Nothing on this website is GPTed. I aim to do a proofreading for each post; yet, I still have a long way to go with my English writing & speaking. Apologies if you find any improper writings.
- I will try to make this website as simple as possible.

If you reached here, thank you -- I admire every person who does read `readme` documents!
