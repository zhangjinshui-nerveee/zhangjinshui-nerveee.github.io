<p class="meta">09 Jan 2022 - Durham</p>

This website will provide the following information.
- Selected projects. I will use as little jargon as possible for a general audience.
- Selected publications. Different from my published papers, I will try to introduce every paper straight to their point. 
- Blogs. 
- Open source project that I led or participated in.

Here are the rules I follow when creating on this website.
- I don't want to waste your time. I will try to be as straightforward and simple as possible. 
- I respect your attention. Anything you read here can only be found here; if they are borrowed from somewhere else, I will make sure to provide the source. 
- You are interacting with a real person here. Nothing on this website is GPTed. I indeed aim to do a proofreading for each post; yet, I still have a long way to go in English writing & speaking. Apologies for any improper writing you might spot on this website.
- I will try to make this website as simple as possible. 
<p style="color: gray; font-size: smaller;"> This neat website style is borrowed from [Tom Werner's personal website](https://tom.preston-werner.com/). </p>

If you get here, thank you! I admire every person who does read `readme` documents!
