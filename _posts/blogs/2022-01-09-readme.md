<p class="meta">09 Jan 2022 - Durham</p>

This website will provide the following information.
- Introduction to my projects. I will use as few jargons as possible for a general audience.
- Explanation of my publications. Different from my published papers, I will try to introduce every paper straight to their point. 
- Blogs. 
- Open source project that I led or participate in.

Here are the rules I follow when creating on this website.
- I don't want to waste your time. I will try to be as straightforward and simple as possible. 
- I respect your attention. Anything you read here can only be found here; if they are borrowed from somewhere else, I will make sure to provide the source. 
- You are interacting with a real person here. I don't use any AI for my writing in general. I will try my best to do a proofreading and polishing after each post. But if there are still mistakes -- my appologies.
- I will try to make this website as simple as possible. <em> This neat website style is borrowed from [Tom Werner's personal website](https://tom.preston-werner.com/). </em>
