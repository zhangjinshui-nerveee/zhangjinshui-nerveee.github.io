This website is my portfolio. And I will share the following information.
- Selected projects, wehre I introduce my projects with as little jargon as possible for a general audience.
- Selected publications, where I selected several papers of mine that I think are interesting.
- Open source project that I led or participated in.
- Blogs. 

Here are a few rules I keep to myself for this website.
- I don't dare to waste your time, so I try my best to be straightforward.
- I respect your attention. Anything you read here belongs only to here; if I borrowed them from somewhere else, I will make sure to provide the source.
- You are interacting with a real person. Nothing on this website is from chat-gpt. 
- I will keep this website simple and fast.
<p style="color: gray; font-size: smaller;"> This neat website style is borrowed from [Tom Werner's personal website](https://tom.preston-werner.com/). I added an option of dark mode.</p>
