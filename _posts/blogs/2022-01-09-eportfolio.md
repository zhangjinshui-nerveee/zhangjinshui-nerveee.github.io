Have you ever struggled to settle down on the style of your personal website? Well, I have, a lot. There are just so many options on the internet, beautiful and free. I used to switch my website from one template to another all the time. I didn't do this for fun, every time I switch, I was literally urged to do so because I felt my previous one was so ugly and it disgusted me too much. If you felt the same way, shake hands. 

One day on my way home on the bus (one thing I really love about taking a bus over driving is that you can really use your time to think about all kind of strange or nonsense questions without worrying that your distraction might kill someone or yourself), I realized that the cause for me obsessively frequent change of my e-portfolio is my ambiguous interpretation of its function. 
Yes, theoretically, it could be my cv, it could be my blog, it could be my gallery, it could be anything, but it can not be just anything. 

It has to serve a purpose for you, just you, instead of the ones who developed those fancy templates. That's why the website repositories I picked from tons of others all end up looking disgusting to me. 
Once the first impression or the freshness phased out, the conflict between the tastes of the original designer and your actual needs makes you feel uncomfortable everytime you visit your website. And this unease eventually accumulates into panic and disgust, especially when everyone else is also using the same template and trying to fill out all the categories that the original design has provided (hey, maybe because, just like me, they simply don't know how to delete the entries but don't want to leave them empty). 

We do not necessarily have to suffer. Figuring out our needs is the first step, and this is mine -- this website is going to be the other side of my cv. 
As I have only very limited space in my cv for my research and projects, some of them may lose the technical or interesting part. I decided to complete these materials on this website, include demonstrations as well as stories (comedy or tragedy) behind all these "achievements" on my cv. Meanwhile, I can't be a real person on cv, I doubt that any one could. Therefore, I will also share some of my thoughts on work and real life, like this one. 

This website will provide the following information.
- Introduction to my projects. I will use as few jargons as possible for a general audience.
- Explanation of my publications. Different from my published papers, I will try to introduce every paper straight to its point. 
- Blogs. 
- Open source project. 

Here are a few rules I follow when maintaining this website.
- I don't want to waste your time. I will try to be straightforward and simple as possible. 
- I respect your attention. Anything you read here can only found be here; if they are borrowed from somewhere else, I will make sure to provide the source link. 
- You are interacting with a real person here. I don't use any AI for my writing in general. I will try my best to do a proofreading and polishing after each post. But if there are still mistakes -- my bad.
- I will try to make this website as simple as possible. <em> This elegant and simple website is forked from [Tom Werner's personal website](https://tom.preston-werner.com/). </em>
