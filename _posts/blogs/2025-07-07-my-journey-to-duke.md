When I was seven, the year 2004, our whole class was summoned to take vaccines. It wasn't injection; instead, it's a pill -- round, sweet. 

Oh, by the way, it might be hard for you to imagine, only twenty years ago, our family didn't actually have much access to sugar. Not because my parents were worried about my health, simply because we couldn't afford.

The vaccine is free and compulsory; it was provided by our government to kill poliomyelitis. Of course I wouldn't understand any of these back then; but the sweet pill just created an emotion in me called happiness. The lobby was full of other kids, several hundreds of them; and it was my turn, finally! I opened my mouth and the doctor put one pill on my tongue. 

Oh my god, it tasted so good ~ sweet, kind of milky, and sweet! I couldn't remember when was the last time I had anything sweet. I was carefully sucking the pill; greedy, but not too hard -- I didn't want it to disappear too fast, and was definitely not going to chew or swallow it. 

But it eventually went away. 

Oh, I missed it already. But what could I do? Yes, I sneaked back to the line, and took another pill. The doctor wouldn't know -- all the kids were wearing the same gray dirty worn-out clothes, and a face flushed from the cold. I took several rounds that afternoon; and I was certainly not the only one who was smart enough to have done so. But that was one of the happiest days of my primary school. 
Don't worry, I am still alive, and I haven't got poliomyelitis yet -- I guess they did work. 

I have no idea how I end up here in North Carolina doing my PhD right now. It seems, even to me, to be a really really long way from a poor Chinese village to an American university. In my mind, I am still a little frog from a small pond. 

I guess I should be grateful for schools, and the whole concept of education. To me, education doesn't just teaching knowledge. It provides an environment where everyone is supposed to be equal. Yeah, I know it might never be strictly equal, but it was designed to be so, and people agree on it. When you don't have it, you can ask for it, with integrity and dignity. Once you are treated equally in school, you are promised a more fair future out of school. 

I didn't figure this out until very recent days, after spending so many years in schools, Chinese and American ones. Yet, my parents, one dropped out at fifth grade and another at sixth, somehow figured it out. Throughout my whole life, they always supported me; sometimes threw me back when I wanted to give up. It reminds me that in outdoor rock climbing, people who are spotting shouldn't try to catch the climber when they fall; instead, they just throw the climber onto the cushion. 

I don't know how they managed to grasp the significance of education, given that they only got eleven years of that -- combined. They still can't speak mandarin (have been speaking Shandong dialect for fifty years and probably forever); they still don't know how to flip the camera to show me their corn field during video calls; but they are geniuses to me. 

What brought me here? Education, undoubtedly. But above all, I think I was given the two best educators from the start.
