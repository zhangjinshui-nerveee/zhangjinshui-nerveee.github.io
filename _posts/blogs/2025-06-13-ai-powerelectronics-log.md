## AI can, will and probably is already, more intelligent than Humanity
One day I was talking with myself: can AI become more intelligent than the humanity? One voice in my head said, come on, don't be stupid. AI is trained with the data generated from us, how can it become smarter than us? It sounds convincing, at first. But another voice threw up one question: Are we human beings becoming more intelligent than our ancestors? The answer to me is yes. Certainly we have all these great thinkers and scientists, but as a society, we are booming, much faster than any other creatures. The technology and science are having amazing innovations, and we are also getting better and better at dealing with our own minds. 

In conclusion, we are getting more intelligent as a spieces, thanks to the knowledge and experience of people before our generation. If we can evolve with the previous knowledge, so can AI. And the pace of it will be even faster than us, much faster, and no doubt it will become more intelligent than us if it isn't already. 

Will we be replaced or discarded? I don't know -- but I try my best to be optimistic. 

People, especially those who are engineers like me, can feel the fear the most. We might still hold doubt on AI's true potential, but the fear is real. I have played Hades II a lot -- it's a toxic game, nobody should play it. But if you do play it, (spoiler warning), before getting to the ultimate boss typhoon, you have to fight through its offsprings, its tails and so. Basically, you get a taste of how terrifying this monster might be before you really face him. This is my feeling now. The AI tools we are working with are surely far away from replacing us, but you can tell how better it might get and how fast it is getting better. 

We are at the dawn of the AI era. 

Here in this blog, I will record what has happened to my field of expertise, power electronics, before AI really took our place.

## Using AI to assist design
- Gemini-Cli: it's huge. It has lots power, but it also needs lots of power, and it seems to acquire so from you, secretly. I would be very cautious of using this tool -- it can do so many things without you knowing about it.
