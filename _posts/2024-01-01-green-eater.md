When I was writing this blog, I kept asking myself: how to writing about the approval of (partial) veganism without being cringe? Then I decided that finding a reason for writing this blog is too hard. I will just list some numbers I collected -- reasons can be false, but math is always true.

The spirit of this blog is to have a direct statistic view of protein consumption and carbon emission.

## Protein can be green, but unfortunately they are not so far

| Food | CO2 emission (kg) / 100 g protein | Calories per gram of protein |
| -- | -- | -- |
| beef | 49.89 | 8.30 |
| lamb | 19.85 | 10.1 |
| cheese | 10.82 | 15.8 |
| milk | 9.5 | 18.6 |
| pork | 7.61 | 9.9 |
| fish (farmed) | 5.98 | 4.72 |
| chicken | 5.7 | 5.3 |
| eggs | 4.21 | 11.8 |
| -- | -- | -- |
| tofu | 1.98 | 8.75 |
| grains | 2.7 | ?? |
| oatmeal | 1.91 | 24.1 |
| nuts | 0.26 | ?? |
| wheat & Rye | 1.29 | ?? |
| edamame | ?? | 12.4 |
| hemp seeds | ?? | 20 |
| peanuts (ground nuts) | 1.23 | 21.4 |

Here is my easy takes on green proteins.
0. A firm **NO** to anything related to **COWS**
1. **REDUCE RED** meat consumption
2. All **VEG**etables are better than any kind of meat
