Prerequisite knowledge:
1. Nearest level modulation has low switching rate but low quantizing quality.
2. Carrier based PWM has high switching rate but high quantizing quality.

Essence of this paper
A quantizing method combining Nearest level modulation and an one-bit PWM approach. Instead a simple combination, we realized that one-bit PWM only works if the input signal has a constrained bandwidth, otherwise this quantizer method is equivalent to level-shifted-carrier PWM. Therefore, we added a low-pass filter before feeding the residue of NLM to PWM.
